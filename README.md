## Description

Carfree is a hyper-minimalist interface to provide the most concise answer to one of lifeâ€™s most commonly asked and urgent questions: "Is it gone rain?" 

As a person without a car 
I want to know if it is going to rain on my walk
So that I don't get rained on. 

## Usage 

Users are asked to give their current location, after which they will enter their desired destination.  Carfree with show them a polyline for walking directions and travel time.  It also lets you know the age old question "Is it gone rain?" 

## Gen 2 Options

At Carfree we would like to add a number of different features like biking and transit functionality, as will as ride share API intergration.
